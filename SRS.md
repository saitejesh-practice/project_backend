## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
This document is a Systems Requirement Specification document which outlines the functional and non-functional requirements of `The Auction House` Project for Release 1.0. This document must be used by the development team to verify the correct functionality of the software.

### 1.2 Project Scope
The scope of the project is to build an online Auction Platform for an imaginary business. The platform should allow users to register and create their profile, add their used/pre-owned assets, place some of their assets on sale with minimum auction price and allow other users to place a bid. The auction entry will be expired after a certain time and the highest bidder will get the ownership of the assets and the platform will facilitate the closure of the transaction. 

## 2. Overall Description
### 2.1 Description (Product Perspective)
The Auction House application is an online platform which allows users to browse various products/assets that other users are willing to sell by the process of Auction. 

### 2.2 User Class
1. A **Seller** Lists an asset he owns at a **Reserve Price (Minimum Listing Price)** defining a **Expiry Date and Time** until which the auction is open for bidding. He would also define a **Incremental Value** which will define the value of the bid for the next bidder. ex. If the current highest bid is $100, the next bidder will have to agree to a pay a price of $110. ($10 incremental)
2. A **User** is able to view a catalog of all open auctions, details of the asset being auctioned and the current highest bid price. User will have a option to place the bid if he is interested in participating in the Auction.
3. A **Bidder** places a bid agreeing to pay the current price + Incremental value if he would endup being the highest bidder.
4. A **Buyer** is a person who ended up being the highest bidder at the end of the Auction process.
5. The **System** takes care of Auction Expiry (Expiry date getting lapsed) and settling the transaction between the Buyer/Seller.
6. An **Administrator** can manage. He regenerate a password of an existing user, verify user activity audit log, block or allow specific users` access or delete a user from the system. 

### 2.3 Operating Environment
* The Website must on all major browsers like IE, Safari, Chrome and Mozilla.
* The Website must be accessible for browsers on the phone confined to the dimensions of the phone (Responsive UI).

### 2.4 Design and Implementation Constraints
* For Release version 1.0, we can ignore the image upload.
* The color theme for the application should be `white`, `gray` and `black`. No other colors should be used.

### 2.5 Assumptions
* The Website will be running 24/7.
* It will use a signal database hosted along side the backend application (same tier).
* The system will not be receiving more that 30 Requests per minute so a single instance of the website is good enough. 

### 2.6 Dependencies
* None

## 3. Business Rules
### 3.1 Rules List
|Rule ID|Description|
|1.|**System**  should ensure the **Bidder** has money in the wallet to be able to afford to place the bid. After placing the bid successfully, the value of the bid amount should be blocked as long as the **Bidder** maintains the highest bidder status. The movement there is another successful bid by another user, the blocked amount should be unblocked and made available for future bidding.|
|2.|As part of the Auction closure process, the assets have to be transfered to the new owner`s assets list. The new owner should be able to auction the asset back into the market by post a new auction. |

## 4. Funcational Requirements
### 4.1 Assets
#### 4.1.1 Create Assets

### 4.3 Dashboard
The main dashboard is like the home page of the application which should be visible for all the users when they first login. This should show all the active auctions in the system sorted by the nearest expiry date. It will also show any bids that the current user might have placed. It should also highlight the bids placed that are still highest bid.

#### 4.3.1 Auction Listing
The system should show all the open auctions hosted by other users sorted by the latest expiry date and active bid (highest bid by the user). The Auction with the highest bid against the user should be on the top, followed by other Auctions that are close to expiring in decending order. It should show `Auction Status`, `Title`, `Description`, `Retail Value`, `Current Highest bid`, `Highest Bidder` and `Next Call` (Next bid amount).

It should also capture `Reserve Price` minimum price from where the bid should start and `Incremental Value` which will be used to calculate the `Next Call` = (`Current Highest bid` + `Incremental Value`) and most importantly `Expiration Time (Mins)`. The Auction should also have the provision for `Highest Bidder` and `Current Highest bid`.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
### 5.1 Low-Traffic
Consideration to be in place to make sure the application architecture is not over designed. As the traffic expectations are less (30 requests per minute), we can host both the database and the application api on the same server. The application api should be REST and exchange data over http and json.
